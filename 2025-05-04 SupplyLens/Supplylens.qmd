## Volkswagen and the Hidden Cost of Batteries

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%" style="font-size: 0.60em;"}

In 2019, **Volkswagen** committed to making electric vehicles more sustainable.  
They published ESG reports, used certified suppliers, and pledged clean sourcing.

But a 2020 investigation by **Amnesty International** found:

- ❗ Cobalt in VW’s batteries traced to **mines in the DRC**  
- ❗ These mines used **child labor and unsafe conditions**  
- ❗ The violations were **several tiers deep** — invisible to VW’s standard audits

> We didn’t see where the real risk was.”

## Nestlé and the Hidden Cost of Palm Oil

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%" style="font-size: 0.60em;"}

In 2020, **Nestlé** pledged to eliminate deforestation from its supply chains and committed to sourcing sustainable palm oil.

However, investigations revealed:

- ❗ Nestlé continued sourcing palm oil from mills linked to deforestation and human rights abuses.
- ❗ Satellite monitoring detected over 1,000 deforestation alerts per day near Nestlé's palm oil suppliers.
- ❗ Reports indicated worker deaths, injuries, and land rights violations associated with some of Nestlé's palm oil sources.

Despite public commitments, these issues persisted in Nestlé's supply chain.

## 🍗 KFC's Great Chicken Shortage of 2018

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%" style="font-size: 0.60em;"}

In February 2018, **KFC UK** faced an unexpected crisis: **a chicken shortage**. The fast-food chain had recently switched its logistics partner from Bidvest, which operated a network of six warehouses, to DHL, which centralized operations to a single warehouse in Rugby.

This strategic change led to:

- ❗ Over 750 KFC outlets across the UK and Ireland temporarily closing due to delivery failures.
- ❗ Significant food waste and financial losses.
- ❗ Public relations challenges, as customers expressed frustration over the lack of chicken.

The incident highlighted the risks of over-centralization and inadequate contingency planning in supply chain management.

> The shortage became a national news story, affecting customer trust.

## 🤫 Why Nobody Wants to Share

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%" style="font-size: 0.50em;"}

Supply chains don’t just suffer from a lack of data.

They suffer from **a lack of trust** — and **incentives to hide**.

Every player has a reason to stay quiet:

- 📦 Tier 1 suppliers don’t want to admit they outsource to Tier 2.
- 🌍 Exporters won’t reveal source farms — they fear being cut out.
- 🏢 Traders obscure price breakdowns to protect margins.
- 🛠 Manufacturers worry about audits, and buyers asking questions.

> If you ask for documents, many will send you PDFs.  
> If you ask where the data came from, the conversation ends.

:::

::: {.column width="45%" style="font-size: 0.50em;"}

> 💰 **Opacity is profitable.**  
> Hiding intermediaries = higher markup.  
> Faking compliance = cheaper business.

---

> 🧨 **Transparency is risky.**  
> Disclosing weak links = losing contracts or getting fined.

---

> 🤷 **There’s no shared map.**  
> So bad actors win by default —  
> because they can **pretend** better than they can prove.

---

> If we want ethical trade,  
> then we need to make **truth a competitive advantage**.

## 🧩 What Would a Real Solution Look Like?

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%" style="font-size: 0.50em;"}

If the playing field rewards **hiding**, then honesty becomes a **disadvantage**.

So a real solution doesn’t just collect data —  
it shifts the **incentives** in the system.

It must:

- 🧭 Make **visibility a strength**, not a risk
- 🛠 Work without forcing new tools on small players
- 🧠 Reason across **missing or fuzzy data**
- 🔍 Show how companies connect — not just who they are
- 🧾 Make it easier to **prove the truth** than to fake it

In short:

> 🧱 It’s not about reporting tools.  
> It’s about building a new type of evidence.

> 🧠 **Understands context and gaps**

> Supply chains are physical, economic, and narrative systems

## 🔍 Introducing SupplyLens

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%" style="font-size: 0.50em;"}

**SupplyLens** is an open-source tool that helps you map the **reality** of supply chains —  
even when the data is fragmented, hidden, or manipulated.

It doesn’t just store documents.  
It **reasons** across them.

It combines:

- 📥 Smart data ingestion (from PDFs, websites, leaks, forms)
- 🧠 LLM-based reasoning to extract relationships and meaning
- 🔗 Graph database structure to reflect how supply chains actually behave
- 🔍 Semantic search and risk detection, even when things aren't said explicitly

And it works with the world as it is —  
Not as we wish it were.

> It thinks through the chain — not just shows it

## 🧠 How SupplyLens Works

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%" style="font-size: 0.50em;"}

**SupplyLens** processes messy, fragmented data — and makes meaning from it.

It takes in:

- 📄 PDFs, websites, spreadsheets, or scans  
- 🔍 NGO reports, invoices, product catalogs  
- 🗂 Structured or unstructured documents

Then it:

- 🧠 Extracts entities, relationships, and sources  
- 🔗 Builds a graph of companies, flows, risks, and gaps  
- 🧾 Annotates each node with metadata, ESG claims, and evidence  
- 🧭 Uses AI to infer missing links or weak spots  
- 💬 Responds to natural language questions about the chain

You don’t need 100's of records. You don’t need a data team.  
You just need a question — and SupplyLens will **trace the answer**.
